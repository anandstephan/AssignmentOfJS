### Class 4

**Topic:** Operators and Other Fundamentals

#### Arithmetic Operators

**Questions:**

1. How does the `+` operator work with numeric operands in JavaScript?
2. Provide examples of using the `+` operator with different types of operands.
3. Explain the use of the `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` operators with examples.
4. What are the `++` and `--` operators and how do they work?

**Coding Questions:**

1. Write a JavaScript function that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides two numbers and returns the results.
2. Create a JavaScript program that increments and decrements a variable using the `++` and `--` operators and prints the results.

#### Logical Operators
**Questions:**

1. What are logical operators in JavaScript? Provide examples.
2. Explain the use of the `&&`, `||`, and `!` operators with examples.

**Coding Questions:**

1. Write a JavaScript function that uses the `&&` operator to check if two conditions are true.
    ```javascript
    function checkConditions(a, b) {
        return a > 0 && b > 0;
    }
    console.log(checkConditions(5, 10)); // true
    ```

2. Create a JavaScript function that uses the `||` operator to check if at least one of two conditions is true.
    ```javascript
    function checkAnyCondition(a, b) {
        return a > 0 || b > 0;
    }
    console.log(checkAnyCondition(-5, 10)); // true
    ```

#### Looping
**Questions:**

1. Explain the `for` loop in JavaScript with an example.
2. Describe the `while` loop and provide an example.
3. What is a `do-while` loop? Provide an example.
4. How do the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` methods work in JavaScript? Provide examples.
5. Explain the difference between `for...in` and `for...of` loops with examples.
6. What is the `forEach` method in JavaScript and how does it work?

**Coding Questions:**

1. Write a JavaScript program that uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.


2. Create a JavaScript function that uses a `while` loop to print the first 5 even numbers.
